## üí° Inspiration
JigYasu is an  One stop web platform portal which will contain all the information about all academic activities of different universities spanning across the country and the international arena in chronological order.


## üíª What it does
It is a multiservice platform which benefits one on all the stages, i.e from registration to earning the certificate; we have covered it all!
All the events portrayed on the portal will be authenticated by checking the authorization of the host.
The portal will be capable of handling all the workshops and seminars conducted across the country, universities and international arena.
This portal allows peer- participants to get connected thereby creating a community.
According to the participants‚Äô interests, they will be notified about the upcoming events and webinars through mails.
It also serves as a platform for the universities to promote their event and showcase themselves on an international platform

## üöÄ What's next for JigYasu
- We are going to use guphsup chatbot on the website to have a virtual chat with the user so that they can get suggestion about the event they want to participate ,on the basis of their interest and so to easily navigate through the site.
- We are going to use google reCAPTCHA so that we can protect our site from spam abuse and cyber attacks
- We are going and for why we are to have a discussion forum and in that we will use php so that we can easily and efficiently connect with the By doing this, we can encourage discussion among the users and be able to help those who seek assistance and support .This in turn will create a healthy environment We also plan on adding a Machine Learning model like OCR, to check if someone is using abusive language and if found guilty, the person would be barred from attending future events.
- For payment gateway we are going to use razorpay.
- In our website we are going to have a subscription service for the event organizers based on if they choose to opt for certificates ,event promotion through mail , customized URL for the event page and the analysis(data stored by the system for example no of clicks and views etc.) of the event list.
